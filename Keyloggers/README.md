### 🔍 **How It Works**
The keylogger works by capturing every keystroke a user makes on their keyboard in real-time. It uses Python’s powerful libraries like `pynput` to monitor and log keystrokes. Here’s how it operates:

1. **Listening for Keystrokes** 🖱️:
   - The keylogger constantly "listens" to your keyboard, capturing every key you press—letters, numbers, special characters, or even function keys like `Enter` and `Backspace`.

2. **Logging Keystrokes** 📜:
   - Each captured keystroke is written to a log file, storing everything you type during the keylogger's runtime.
   - For instance, if you type a password, username, or personal message, it gets saved in the log file.

3. **Running in the Background** 🔮:
   - The keylogger runs silently, meaning there are no visible windows or notifications.
   - On Windows, it can be run as a "hidden process" using `pythonw` instead of `python`, making it completely invisible to the user.

4. **Example Use Case** 🛠️:
   - When you run the keylogger script, it creates a log file named `keystrokes.txt` (or similar). This file keeps appending every key pressed until the script stops.

### 🚨 **Disclaimer**
This keylogger is intended for **educational purposes only**. Misusing it for unauthorized purposes is unethical, illegal, and can lead to serious consequences. Always obtain proper permission before testing or deploying tools like this.

### 🛠️ **How to Run It in the Background**
1. **On Windows**:
   - Use `pythonw` to run the script without showing a terminal window:
     ```bash
     pythonw keylogger.py
     ```

2. **On macOS/Linux**:
   - Use `nohup` to run the script in the background:
     ```bash
     nohup python keylogger.py &
     ```

3. **Check the Logs**:
   - The keystrokes will be saved in a file like `keystrokes.txt`.
