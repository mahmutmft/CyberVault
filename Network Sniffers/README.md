# 🌐 Network Sniffer Simulation Explanation

---

## 🔍 How It Works

This network sniffer simulation captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time. It demonstrates how packets travel across a network and provides insight into their structure. Here’s how it operates:

### Packet Capture 🔄:

- The script listens to network traffic on the current interface.
- It uses Python’s `scapy` library to capture raw packets, including TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols.

### Protocol Analysis 🛠️:

- Each captured packet is analyzed to extract:
  - Source and destination IP addresses.
  - Protocol type (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
  - Additional details like ports and ICMP types.

### Packet Logging 📝:

- Captured packet data is saved to a timestamped log file (`packet_log_xxxxxxxx_xxxxx.txt`) for later analysis.
- Logs include detailed information such as IP addresses, ports, and protocol-specific data.

### Example Use Case 🚦:

- When you run the script, it monitors network traffic in real-time.
- You can filter by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP) or capture all traffic.
- Logs are stored in a file for further review or debugging purposes.

## 🚨 Disclaimer

This script is intended for **educational purposes only**. It is designed to help you understand network traffic and protocol analysis in a safe and controlled environment. Monitoring network traffic without proper authorization is unethical, illegal, and can result in severe consequences.

## 🛠️ How to Use the Simulation

### Capture Network Traffic

1. Run the script with administrator/root privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo python advanced_network_sniffer.py
   ```

2. Follow the prompts to select a protocol filter:

   - `tcp` to capture only TCP packets.
   - `udp` to capture only UDP packets.
   - `icmp` to capture only ICMP packets.
   - `all` to capture all packets.

3. View real-time captured packets in the terminal.

### Save and Analyze Logs

1. Captured packets are automatically logged to a timestamped file (`packet_log_xxxxxxxx_xxxxx.txt`).
2. Open the log file to review details of captured packets.
