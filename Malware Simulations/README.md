# 🔐 Ransomware Simulation Explanation

---

### 🔍 **How It Works**

This ransomware simulation demonstrates the concept of ransomware by encrypting and decrypting files in a controlled environment. Here’s how it operates:

1. **File Encryption** 🔒:

   - The script encrypts all files in the current directory (except excluded files like itself, key files, and documentation).
   - It uses Python’s `cryptography` library, which provides secure encryption algorithms.

2. **Key Management** 🔑:

   - During encryption, the script generates a unique encryption key and saves it to a file named `encryptionKey.key`.
   - This key is required to decrypt the files. Without it, decryption is impossible.

3. **File Decryption** 🗝️:

   - Using the saved key, the script decrypts the previously encrypted files and restores them to their original state.

4. **Example Use Case** 🛠️:
   - When you run the script, it encrypts all test files in the same directory.
   - Once encrypted, you can decrypt them by running the script again and selecting the decryption option.

### 🛠️ **How to Use the Simulation**

#### **Encrypt Files**

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python ransomwareSimulation.py
   ```
2. Select option `1` to encrypt files.
3. A key file named `encryptionKey.key` will be generated in the same directory.

#### **Decrypt Files**

1. Ensure the `encryptionKey.key` file is in the same directory.
2. Run the script again and select option `2` to decrypt the files.
